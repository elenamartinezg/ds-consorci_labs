-- ## Challenge - Joining on multiple tables

-- Write SQL queries to perform the following tasks using the Sakila database:


-- 1. List the number of films per category.
SELECT c.name AS category_name, COUNT(fc.film_id) AS film_count
FROM category c
JOIN film_category fc ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
GROUP BY c.name;

-- 2. Retrieve the store ID, city, and country for each store.
SELECT s.store_id, ci.city, co.country
FROM store s
JOIN address a ON s.address_id = a.address_id
JOIN city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id
JOIN country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id;

-- 3.  Calculate the total revenue generated by each store in dollars.
SELECT s.store_id, SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM store s
JOIN customer c ON s.store_id = c.store_id
JOIN payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY s.store_id;

-- 4.  Determine the average running time of films for each category.
-- Entiendo como avg running time duraciones medias de las pel√≠culas
SELECT c.name AS category_name, AVG(f.length) AS average_running_time
FROM category c
JOIN film_category fc ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
GROUP BY c.name;

-- **Bonus**:

-- 5.  Identify the film categories with the longest average running time.
SELECT c.name AS category_name, AVG(f.length) AS average_running_time
FROM category c
JOIN film_category fc ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY average_running_time DESC;

-- 6.  Display the top 10 most frequently rented movies in descending order.
SELECT f.title, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
FROM film f
JOIN inventory i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
JOIN rental r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
GROUP BY f.title
ORDER BY rental_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 7. Determine if "Academy Dinosaur" can be rented from Store 1.

-- 8. Provide a list of all distinct film titles, along with their availability status in the inventory. Include a column indicating whether each title is 'Available' or 'NOT available.' Note that there are 42 titles that are not in the inventory, and this information can be obtained using a `CASE` statement combined with `IFNULL`."
